* Python 3.8+
* Git

### Setup Instructions

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/coderrr.git
   cd coderrr
   ```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Python virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   # On Windows:
   .\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   # On Linux/Mac:
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Create your `.env` file**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

6. **Link the CLI for local development**
   ```bash
   npm link
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test
node test/test-scanner.js
node test/test-agent-scanner.js
```

## Style Guides

### JavaScript Style Guide

* Use 2 spaces for indentation
* Use semicolons
* Use single quotes for strings
* Use meaningful variable names
* Add JSDoc comments for functions
* Follow existing code patterns

### Python Style Guide

* Follow PEP 8
* Use 4 spaces for indentation
* Use type hints where appropriate
* Add docstrings to functions and classes

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add codebase scanner feature

- Implement automatic project scanning
- Cache results for performance
- Add tests for scanner functionality

Closes #42
```

## Project Architecture

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

The backend (`main.py`) handles:
- AI model communication (Mistral/GitHub Models)
- Request/response processing
- JSON schema enforcement

### Frontend (Node.js)

The CLI (`src/`) handles:
- User interaction
- File operations
- Command execution with permission
- TODO list management
- Auto-testing

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Backend handles AI, frontend handles file system
2. **Permission-Based Execution**: All commands require user approval
3. **Codebase Awareness**: Scanner provides project context to AI
4. **Modular Architecture**: Each feature is a separate module

## Testing Guidelines

* Write tests for new features
* Ensure existing tests pass
* Test both success and failure cases
* Include integration tests for major features

## Documentation

* Update README.md for user-facing changes
* Update .github/copilot-instructions.md for architecture changes
* Add JSDoc comments to new functions
* Create examples for new features

## Review Process

1. Create a feature branch
2. Make your changes
3. Write/update tests
4. Update documentation
5. Submit a pull request
6. Respond to review feedback
7. Celebrate when merged! ðŸŽ‰
