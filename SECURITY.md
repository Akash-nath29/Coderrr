| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Coderrr seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Please do NOT:

- Open a public issue
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before it has been addressed

### Please DO:

1. **Email** the details to the project maintainers (create a GitHub Security Advisory)
2. **Include** the following information:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to expect:

- **Acknowledgment** within 48 hours
- **Assessment** within 5 business days
- **Fix timeline** communicated within 10 business days
- **Public disclosure** coordinated with you after the fix

## Security Best Practices for Users

### API Keys

- **Never commit** `.env` files to version control
- **Use** `.env.example` for templates only
- **Rotate** API keys regularly
- **Limit** API key permissions to minimum required

### Backend Security

- **Run backend** on localhost only by default
- **Use** environment variables for all secrets
- **Enable** firewall rules if exposing backend
- **Keep** dependencies up to date

### CLI Usage

- **Review** all commands before approving execution
- **Don't** disable permission prompts in production
- **Be cautious** with file operations on critical files
- **Backup** important files before agent modifications

### Dependencies

- **Regularly update** Node.js and Python dependencies
- **Review** `npm audit` and `pip check` outputs
- **Pin** critical dependency versions

## Known Security Considerations

### AI-Generated Code

- Code generated by AI should be reviewed before execution
- Permission prompts are mandatory for command execution
- File operations are logged for audit trail

### Backend Exposure

- Default backend runs on localhost:8000
- Exposing backend to network requires additional security:
  - HTTPS/TLS encryption
  - Authentication middleware
  - Rate limiting
  - CORS configuration

### Environment Variables

- `.env` contains sensitive API keys
- Never share `.env` files
- Use different keys for dev/prod

## Security Features

- ✅ Permission-based command execution
- ✅ Environment variable isolation
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets
- ✅ Local-first architecture
- ✅ User confirmation for destructive operations
